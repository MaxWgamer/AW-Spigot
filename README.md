# AW-Spigot
1.8.8 Optimized with KnockBack Editor PaperSpigot Fork used by AntiWolf

## Introduction

> Originally this fork was used by the AntiWolf server but since the closure I decided to make it public.

## How to use and why I posted it

> To use it import it as a Maven project but take into account that I would not do any maintenance and that I publish this in memory of the good old days.


## Credits

> If you decide to use the project do not hesitate to mention me in the credits.
